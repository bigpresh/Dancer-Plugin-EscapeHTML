        Er, adding new files to MANIFEST would give the test suite more chance
        of running.  Muppet!  (Thanks to ambs for reporting!)

        Avoid messing around escaping the internals of blessed objects in the
        template tokens unless the new traverse_objects setting is set to a true
        value - thanks to Tom Rathborne again (@trathborne)

        Declaring Dancer as a dependency would be useful!  No other changes.

        Add exclude_pattern option, to exclude certain template param/token
        names from automatic escaping.

        Add some tests; no functional changes.

0.01    2011-08-09
